💫 About Me
Hello, I'm Hümeyra Gül Nuray 👩🏻‍💻

I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Mersin University who is passionate about full-stack development, backend architecture, cloud systems, and IoT technologies.

Throughout my academic journey and internship experience, I have focused on building real-world, scalable systems rather than only academic projects. I enjoy designing complete software architectures — from database modeling to API development, authentication, frontend integration, and deployment.

🏢 Internship Experience
During my internship, I worked on enterprise-level systems and gained hands-on experience in:

Git & branch management

TFS 2018 & pipeline systems

Code review processes

Version control strategies

Project architecture planning

Team-based software development

I learned how professional teams manage builds, CI/CD processes, and production-level code integrity. This experience strengthened my understanding of software lifecycle management and collaborative development.

🚀 Projects & Technical Focus
🔹 Full-Stack Web Development
I developed multiple full-stack applications using:

ASP.NET Core Web API

JWT Authentication

Entity Framework Core

SQL Server

Flutter (Frontend Integration)

RESTful API architecture

Role-based authorization

Error handling & logging

One of my major projects is a complete E-Commerce Application with:

Secure JWT login system

Product listing & management

Cart system

Backend API architecture

Database integration

Clean layered structure

🔹 Cloud & Serverless Architecture (AWS)
I built a Task Management Application using:

AWS Lambda

API Gateway

DynamoDB

Cognito Authentication

S3 (Frontend hosting)

This project helped me understand:

Serverless architecture

REST API design

Cloud authentication flows

CORS management

Production deployment structure

🔹 IoT & Embedded Systems
I also developed hardware-based projects including:

ESP32-CAM Smart Doorbell System

Telegram bot integration

Motion detection & sensor systems

Servo motor, LM35, Ultrasonic sensor integration

HTTP request handling from embedded devices

Through these projects, I gained strong knowledge in:

Microcontroller programming

Real-time sensor data processing

Network-based device communication

✨ Who Am I as a Developer?
I am detail-oriented, structured, and highly analytical.
I enjoy understanding systems deeply rather than memorizing tools.

I love breaking complex systems into manageable components and building them step by step.

I am constantly learning, documenting, and improving myself — not just coding, but understanding why things work.
